# How to Install Leaf Essentials

## Easy Installation Steps
1. **Download the Pack**  
Get the Leaf Essentials `.mcaddon` file from our official site or Discord.

2. **Open the File**  
Tap or double-click the `.mcaddon` to import it into Minecraft automatically. On Android, you may need another file manager that DOES support opening `.mcaddon` files.

3. **Activate in World Settings**  
Go to your world’s **Behavior Packs** and **Resource Packs** tabs.
Select and activate **Leaf Essentials** in both sections.
MAKE SURE BETA APIS IS ENABLED!
