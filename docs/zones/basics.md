title: Zones - Basics
---

## Creating a zone

Open customizer, go to the add page, and add a zone (should be near the bottom of the add submenu)

Type a name, set a starting and ending position, and dimension if needed. Priority can be left alone unless you need a zone inside of a zone.

## Testing zone boundaries

In leaf, there is an item called "zone borders". Grab one and use it, and you can visualize zone boundaries. Zone boundaries will get brighter if the zone is currently the active one

## About priority

If you have zones inside of zones, leaf will take the one with the largest priority number.

## Teleporting to zones

In the zones edit menu, you have 3 buttons for teleporting:
- Pos1
- Pos2
- Center

Pos1 is the first corner set in the zone settings, while Pos2 is the second.
Center is the calculated center between those 2 corners
