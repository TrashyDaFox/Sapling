Triggering an event: `/leaf:trigger <eventname>`

In a repeating always active command block, do `/leaf:on <eventname>`

In sebsequent chain conditional command blocks, they will only be activated when the event by `eventname` is triggered

This is a lil replacement I made for the age old method of setting a redstone block in some arbritrary location
