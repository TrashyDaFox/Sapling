Ever wanted to make gambling? Well here you go!

This one is NOT a slash command, but instead a scriptevent.

Usage: `/scriptevent leaf:weighted_rng <objective> <outcomes>`

`<objective>` is just the scoreboard objective btw

How to format outcomes:
- Outcomes are just a list of numbers separated by spaces

"10 1 90 2" would be a 10% chance for 1, 90% chance for 2

If the percentages do not add up to 100, leaf will attempt to normalize them so they do.
