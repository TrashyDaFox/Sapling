NOTE: This is not a teams system. Im not sure why I named it teams.

Usage: `/scriptevent leaf:switch_team <name>`

This will switch the player to another team. This does absolutely nothing other than making it so the player cant hit others in the same team

The default team is named `default`. This team has special behavior so players in the default team can hit other players in it, which means people in default team can attack anyone (assuming the attack isnt cancelled under other conditions set by leaf outside this system)
