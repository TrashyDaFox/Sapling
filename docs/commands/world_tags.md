Adding world tags: `/leaf:wtag_add <name>`
Removing world tags: `/leaf:wtag_remove <name>`
Checking for tag: `/leaf:wtag_has <name>`

Checking for world tag (in leaf conditions): `$wtag/<name>`

Like [/on](/commands/trigger), `/leaf:wtag_has` will activate chain conditional command blocks ONLY if the tag is on the world
