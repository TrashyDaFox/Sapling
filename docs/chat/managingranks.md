## Managing ranks

Open "Config UI", then head over to Chat Ranks in "Main Settings"

## Single rank mode

If you want players to be able to have multiple ranks, but only display 1 rank in chat, enable single rank mode

## Editing defaults

In defaults, the rank is the rank text, and the colors are pretty self explanatory

## Adding ranks

This is mostly the same as adding ranks, but you have a tag. If a player has the tag, it will give them the rank. Priority will choose where the ranks show.
