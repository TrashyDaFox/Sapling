title: Plant Kitty

The mascot for leaf. If you wanna make some art for him, heres some guidelines:

-   Black fur (likely not pure black, maybe a cool very dark gray?) because most devs use dark mode and it originated from a comment in leafs source code
-   Maybe some green or nature themed parts?

Its mostly up to interpretatioon!

If you do genuinely want to make art of it send it in the **#plant-kitty channel** in the **leaf discord server** in the thread under the message. Only do this if you genuinely want to though.

I'll put anything u guys make on this page :D
